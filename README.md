# Trout Discord Bot

This bot is created using TypeScript and Discord.js. It was originally meant for the University of Manitoba chapter of IEEE Discord server to emulate the trout-slapping features in Wikipedia. It was developed by Mahyar Mirrashed (Chair 2021-2022) as part of his incoming role during the summer.
